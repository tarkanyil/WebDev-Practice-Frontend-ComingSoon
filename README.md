# WebDev-Practice (front-end) - Base-Apparel

This is me, on my way to a new web developer carreer. In this section I'm practicing front-end skills, reproducing images into HTML, CSS and JavaScript. 

In this challenge I recreated desktop and mobile version of the coming soon page of a fashion company, based on designs and media input provided.

This newbie-level challenge provided by www.frontendmentor.io, I'm very grateful to them. Their content is very helpful in providing practice options for up and coming developers.
